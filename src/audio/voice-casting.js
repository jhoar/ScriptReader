/**
 * Matching a role to a voice by what the script says and what the voice is.

 * The Kokoro path in voice-catalog.js has always done this, against a curated
 * list of 25 voices with hand-written traits. The cloning engines could not:
 * `mapVoiceAcrossEngines` hands Chatterbox "the first voice in the library
 * nobody else took", so a sixty-year-old villain got whatever the writer
 * happened to import third. That was not an oversight so much as a consequence
 * — a cloned voice had no traits to match on.
 *
 * It does now. A voice imported from the bundled catalog carries the reader's
 * recorded sex, the age band and accent from the annotation sets, and the
 * measured pitch register, so the same intent the Kokoro shortlist expresses can
 * be applied to 1,150 voices.
