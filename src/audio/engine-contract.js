/**
 * The contract every synthesis engine satisfies.
 *
 * `ScreenplayAudioManager` drives synthesis through exactly this surface, so an
 * engine can be swapped without the scheduler, the lookahead loop, or the
 * teleprompter knowing anything changed. The scheduling half of this app —
 * anchors, cluster atomicity, the monotonic timeline edge — is entirely
 * engine-agnostic and stays that way.
 *
 * An engine renders; it never plays. Playback belongs to `PlaybackScheduler`,
 * which is why `gain`, `filter`, and `pan` are absent from everything here:
 * those are applied to the Web Audio graph after synthesis and work identically
 * whichever engine produced the buffer.

 *                             has several (`openai:gpt-4o-mini-tts`), so swapping
 *                             models invalidates cleanly instead of silently
 *                             serving renders from the old one.
 * @property {string}  label   Shown in the engine picker.
 * @property {boolean} supportsSpeed
 *   True when the engine has a tempo control that preserves pitch. The director
 *   uses this to decide whether it may play the tempo/pitch cancellation trick
 *   or must express tempo in words instead.
 * @property {boolean} supportsInstructions
 *   True when the engine accepts free-text direction. When set, emotion is handed
 *   to the model as a stage direction rather than synthesised out of pitch and
 *   speed arithmetic.
 * @property {boolean} [usesInstructionPitch]
 *   Preserve native audio and express register changes through instructions.
 * @property {boolean} isLocal   Nothing leaves the device.
 * @property {boolean} metered   Renders cost money. Gates spend caps, the
 *                               re-render confirmation, and seek debouncing.
 * @property {number}  nativeSampleRate
 * @property {number}  maxChunkChars
 *   How far the director may let one request run. Small for Kokoro so playback
 *   can start early; large for instruction engines, which re-interpret the
 *   direction per request and so give a long speech independently-invented
 *   prosody at every seam.
 * @property {number}  concurrency  How many renders may be in flight at once.
 * @property {'webspeech'|'error'} onUnavailable
 *   What `play()` does when the engine will not start. Falling back to the
 *   browser's built-in voice is right for a failed local download and wrong for
 *   a missing API key — silently dropping someone who chose paid cloud voices
 *   onto the robotic fallback hides the one thing they need to be told.
